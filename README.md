# DPLA
Repository dedicated to Wayne State University Library's (WSU) involvement in Michigan's [DPLA Service Hub] (http://dp.la/info/hubs/#our-service-hubs).

WSU is acting as a "Sub-Hub" in the greater statewide Service Hub initiative.  WSU will aggregate collections from SouthEast Michigan, in addition to its own digital collections, and provide a single stream of metadata to our state's central hub (planned: UM).  That central hub will provide a single stream of metadata to DPLA.

We have spun up a server at [metadata.library.wayne.edu] (http://metadata.library.wayne.edu) that will serve as a focal point for metadata assets that WSU has to offer, DPLA or otherwise.  

## REPOX
We are running the OAI-PMH based aggregator software, REPOX v3.0, to harvest and aggregate metadata that we will provide to DPLA.  This stream is not currently available to the public, but all records contained therein will be available via DPLA soon.

REPOX URL: [http://metadata.library.wayne.edu/repox] (http://metadata.library.wayne.edu/repox)

For more information see the [REPOX] (./REPOX) folder in this repository.
