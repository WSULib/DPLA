# DPLA
Repository dedicated to Wayne State University Library's (WSU) involvement in Michigan's [DPLA Service Hub] (http://dp.la/info/hubs/#our-service-hubs).

WSU is acting as a "Sub-Hub" in the greater statewide Service Hub initiative.  WSU will aggregate collections from SouthEast Michigan, in addition to its own digital collections, and provide a single stream of metadata to our state's central hub.  That central hub will provide a single stream of metadata to DPLA.

We have spun up a server at [metadata.library.wayne.edu] (http://metadata.library.wayne.edu) that will serve as a focal point for metadata assets that WSU has to offer, DPLA or otherwise.
